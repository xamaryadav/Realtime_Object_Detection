# Realtime_Object_Detection
Real-time object detection through Laptop or PC Webcam/Video using Python+ Tensorflow + OpenCV

# Overview
This project is written in Python to perform real-time object detection on security cameras, webcams or video files.

The pre-trained model COCO SSD was used with Tensorflow to recognise objects in the video frame that was collected. OpenCV was then used to draw a rectangle where the object was found and to produce a text that included the name of the object that was detected.

 1. Tensorflow
 2. OpenCV
 3. Model COCO SSD
 4. Python

# Run

```
python Object_Dectection.py
```
